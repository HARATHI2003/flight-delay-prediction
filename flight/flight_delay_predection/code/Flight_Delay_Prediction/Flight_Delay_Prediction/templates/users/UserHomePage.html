        Flight delays critically impact passengers, airlines, and the economies of affected regions. 
        We aimed to predict flight delays by developing a structured prediction system that utilizes 
        flight data to forecast departure delays accurately. This project involved a comprehensive 
        analysis of various machine learning methods, utilizing a dataset containing flight information.
    </p>

    <p>
        The primary focus was on extracting valuable insights from this extensive dataset to accurately 
        predict flight delays. By conducting thorough assessments and comparative analyses, we evaluated 
        different methods for their effectiveness in predicting delays. These insights aim to help airlines 
        improve flight planning, minimize delays, and enhance passenger experience.
